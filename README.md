# House-Price-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression

## Description
It is an application of the linear regression in the machine learning field.

The Training and Testing data are from the Kaggle Competition for House prices Prediction using advanced regression techniques.

In this project I used Linear Regression with NumPy only and also used the Linear Regression built in sklearn library and used the Mean Absolute Error to detect the accuracy of the program.

## Running the program
you can run it in a google colab notebook if you want to visualize all the data since its size would be very large for a text editor.
